#
# Basic configuration file for pkg-mgr
#
# The format is as the following:
#       key=value
# 
# Lines can be commented out with #
# Lines delimit their keys and values with =
# Delimiters can be escaped with \
# If a line has no delimiter, it is ignored
# All delimiters after the first non-escaped delimiter are treated as part of the value of the key
# if a line has a delimiter as its first character, it is ignored
# If a line has a delimiter as its last character, it is ignored
# Any spaces before the first non-escaped delimiter are treated as part of the key
# Any spaces after the first non-escaped delimiter are treated as part of the value
#
# The two default locations for configuration files are /etc/pkg-mgr.conf and $HOME/.config/pkg-mgr.conf
# However, this can be changed at compile-time. The default options for your build can be shown with --help --verbose
#
# Per-user configuration files take all of the same options as the system-wide configuration file, save for userConfigPath
# Currently, all userConfigPath vars are relative to the user's $HOME directory
#   Consequentially, when running this as root (including via sudo), the configuration file in root's home directory will be read
#   This is intended behavior. When you are running this for the system via root, the system settings will apply, guarenteeing consistency, even when various users install packages to the system
#   When running this as a normal user, your own $HOME variable will be read. This is so that a user can use this to manage package installations on their own home directory as well
# Per-user configuration files override the system-wide configuration file, and is overridden by command line arguments
#

# Prints out more information about what exactly the program is doing; Mutually exclusive with quiet; Overridden by --verbose
# 0 Silences almost all output
# 1 Prints our only errors and warnings
# 2 Prints out a few status updates
# 3 Prints out a lot of status updates
# 4 Prints out a massive amount of information, status updates, and variable values
#verbosity=2

# When installing a package, verifies whether or not the files within that package exist before installing; If they do, it will ask you if you want to continue
# When uninstalling, verifies whether or not other installed packages share files with the package being uninstalled; If they do, it will ask you if you want to continue

# Note that this option will be ignored when used in the user configuration file
